Hello!, my name is Karan Pal. I'm a not a beginner in world of coding but due to many breaks it feels like i'm beginning from the start.
Here in 2026, I have started learning again and implementing Python, some DSA and SQL.
Also i'm learning how to get familiar with Github by pushing various files daily. I hope i'll become comfortable with all these things sooner :)
